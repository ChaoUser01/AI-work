# AI-work

A collection of Python-based projects demonstrating key concepts in artificial intelligence, neural networks, natural language processing, and machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Manual-Net/**  
  Hand-built neural network implementation, coded from scratch using pure mathematics and Python. No external ML libraries used.  
  Manually Implemeanted Activation functions like(ReLu, Softmax, Sigmoid and Google's Swish function), forward and backward propagation, and training loops.
  Neural Network bias and active neuron data alongside the accuracy curve per 50 epochs are displayed.

- **hs/**  
  Simple hate speech detection using Twitter tweet data.  
  Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and basic ML classification for tweet datasets.  
  Cleaned and vectorize social media data and apply standard models for binary classification.

- **markov/**  
  Markov chain word generator and predictor.  
  Implements markov chains for generating text and predicting the next word based on historical sequences.  
  Useful for text generation, auto-completion, and probabilistic language modeling.

- **test-net/**  
  A convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using PyTorch modules.  
  Typical use-case: MNIST digit classification.  
  Demonstrates defining, training, and evaluating CNNs with a modern deep learning framework.
